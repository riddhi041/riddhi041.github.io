There are a million things I could say about Mumbai that could make anybody’s heart sing, but I want to dedicate this blog to the Mumbai Traffic.

I learnt to drive a car here, now that I am so proficient in driving on Mumbai roads, I can confidently say that I could drive anywhere. Owning a car in this city means you should stop worrying about the side view mirrors coz they are bound to be bumped against time and again. The route from my office to home measured a mere 4 kms, yet it took me 40 minutes each day to reach my home, if at all I was lucky, and it was a normal day. On some tough days, I would be stuck in the traffic for more than 2 hours, I would bang my head, kick hard, hurl bad words, even then this would not pass. With practice, the time spent on road finally became a leisure only after I developed a habit of catching up on songs and warmed up to the radio. The days I used the bike were a boon, the obsession of escaping the traffic allowed me to discover many internal roads that I shall never disclose, obviously I don’t want people to start using these and create a traffic here too. There would never be a time when I was not running, especially when there was a flight to catch, I had to start hours before to reach the airport in case the traffic chose to betray me. Now that all is said and done, I really have to say this about the Mumbai traffic, it taught me to be patient and more importantly the endurance made me realize why people say “home sweet home”.      

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
