These images are from My World in minecraft !!

Well it began by mistake, I clicked some link which led me to this game. The game got me so curious, I had to go on YouTube to find out a way to download the Tlauncher to play the game. The arena encompasses numerous waterfalls, mountains, deserts, snowcaps, wild jungles, somewhere I would love to go and loose myself. It even gets dark in the game, sun literally goes down and stars shine in the sky. Initially when I started playing it, I kept on dying, with each passing day I learnt to protect myself from the skeletons and the zombies, I learnt to build myself a campfire, build a bed, build tools, and so many other things. You don’t require printed paper to survive in this world, each day is an adventure, you can roam around anywhere at your heart’s desire. You learn to make something new each time you play this game, a place to vent out, but the output is going to be something creative and colorful!

I wander around rowing in my boat, I get leather from cows and horses, wool from sheep, pork from pigs, and eggs and feathers from chicken. For food I prepare mushroom stews, pies, collect apples and roast meat. I am a proud owner of 2 castles, one beach house, one riverfront home, a museum and a monument made of glass, all made from different material like sand, stone and wood. Each one of these homes has beds, lamps, paintings, chests for storage, torches, carpets, libraries, loom, furnaces, and every other utility imaginable. During the day, I leave my nearest home to collect flowers to make dyes, collect wool, collect iron ingots and am on the lookout for buried treasure. 

I have hopelessly fallen in love with this game, it gives me a primitive child like excitement. I am laying tracks currently to move my minecart along and connect all of my homes. I shall be posting a video of my best glass castle soon, Stay tuned !!
