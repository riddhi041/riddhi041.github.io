With the recent happenings, all I can think about is if the end of the world is nearing. Will it be World War III that will be the doom, or will it be a pandemic of multiple diseases that shall wipe mankind from this planet ? 

Sometimes I wonder if the time during lockdown was given as a bonus to stay with the loved ones, or at least stay connected with them, a reckoning that something even catastrophic is going to happen.

Although, according to the Book of Revelation (Part of Bible’s New Testament), before the End, there will be several years of dreadful calamities after return of Jesus; Also, according to the Quran, before the Qayamat, there will appear a messiah and there will be 40 days of smoke and 3 major earthquakes before world ends. Hindu mythology states something very similar about Pralaya, an avatar of Lord Vishnu will take birth and shall open the gates for Judgement Day. The way I interpret this is that we are waiting for someone either to end us or save us but, are not all religions saying that ‘The End’ is the ‘Saving’? 

Any which ways, when I think about the apocalypse, some how I am unable to shake away Elon Musk from my thoughts. Is he going to jump in a space craft and leave this planet as soon as disaster strikes ? Also, which could be the safest place to be at, the South Pole?
